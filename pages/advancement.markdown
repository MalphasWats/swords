Killing monsters, solving puzzles and discovering new places all earn your 
character Experience Points (XP).

As you grow in experience, so you grow in power. The table below describes 
the XP required for each level of power.

## Levelling Up

For each *even* level you gain, your saving throw is reduced by 1.

You gain and roll a new **1d6** Hit Die. Roll it and add your Constitution 
bonus to determine the hit points that you gain.

For magic-using characters - roll **1d4** and add any bonuses from 
Intelligence to determine the mana points you gain.
