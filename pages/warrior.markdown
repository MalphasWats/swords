# Warrior

| Saving Throw |  Power  |
|:------------:|---------|
|      16      | Martial |

A Warrior's primary attribute is *Strength*. Gain HP equal to your Strength damage bonus.

You are awesome at fighting and using muscle and brawn, as a mighty warrior or skilled 
woodsman or grizzled mercenary. You can use any/all weapons and armor.

You gain a bonus to un-armed combat. Roll **1d6** for damage instead of **1d4**


### Abilities

As a Warrior, your abilities take the form of feats of focus and discipline. During the course of combat, you
gain focus points, representative of your tactical training and skill with your weapons. You may spend these focus
points on your turn (although the effect does not have to be immediate) to augment your attacks.

Below are some examples of possible powers. You do not have to limit yourself to just these, but your Game Master
will decide on the cost of the actions you wish to take.

| Focus Cost | Ability                             |
|:----------:|-------------------------------------|
|     1      | Increase your damage by 1           |
|     2      | Deal half damage to a second target |
|     5      | Ignore **1d4** hp of wounds         |


## Hero Classes
