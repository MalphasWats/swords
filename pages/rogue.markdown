# Rogue

| Saving Throw |  Power  |
|:------------:|---------|
|      14      | Martial |

The Rogue is a figure in the shadows, an expert in stealth and delicate tasks. 

As a Rogue, locks, traps, and scouting are your trade.

You may wear leather armour and wield most weapons, you deal double damage and 
gain +4 to attack when attacking from behind.

A Rogue's primary attribute is Dexterity. You gain a damage bonus equal to your 
Dexterity's To Hit modifier.


### Abilities

As a Rogue, your abilities take the form of tricks and misdirections. During the course 
of combat, you gain focus points, representative of your cunning and speed. You may spend 
these focus points on your turn (although the effect does not have to be immediate) to 
augment your attacks.

Below are some examples of possible powers. You do not have to limit yourself to just 
these, but your Game Master will decide on the cost of the actions you wish to take.

| Focus Cost | Ability                           |
|:----------:|-----------------------------------|
|     1      | Increase your damage by 1         |
|     2      | Stun your opponent for 30 seconds |
|     5      | Vanish from sight                 |
