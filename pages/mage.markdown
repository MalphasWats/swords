# Mage

| Saving Throw |  Power  |
|:------------:|---------|
|      15      |  Magic  |

You are skilled in the arcane and mysterious arts of magic. You have little training in other areas, 
so you may not use any armor and you can only use daggers, staffs and darts as weapons.
You begin the game with a spellbook into which you may copy as many spells as you discover, however, 
you may only use as many as your Intelligence allows. Each day you must memorize the spells you wish 
to use. These spells may be cast as many times as your Mana Pool allows.

Level 1 Spells cost 1 Mana to use.

Roll *1d6* when you begin, your spellbook contains that many spells.

Roll on the table below to determine which spells you know.

## Familiars

At level 2, Mages gain the ability to control a Familiar. Your familiar may be any non-sentient creature 
that you encounter.

Once you find an animal, you begin the process of bringing it under your control by channeling magical energy
into it. You must be able to channel for 5 minutes without being interrupted and you will need to expend 5 mana
in order to successfully bring the creature under your control.

Once under your control, your Familiar will obey your every command. The link you forge with your Familiar
allows you to use its senses as your own. Your Familiar gains Experience Points at 1/10th of the rate that you
do. As it gains levels, your Familiar will be able to learn simple spells and may act as a mana reservoir for
your own spells.
