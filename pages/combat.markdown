# Combat

Combat follows the following steps:
1.	Determine Initiative: roll **1d6**, the highest result goes first (initiative is rolled per side, not character/creature)
2.	Winner of initiative takes their turn, acting in whatever order they decide. Results take effect
3.	Loser of initiative takes their turn. Results takes effect
4.	If a side 'held' initiative, they go now (winners can hold off to see what happens)
5.	Round is complete, goto 1

If initiative is a tie, both sides act simultaneously. Spell-casters hit before they act are 
interrupted and cannot cast a spell on their turn.

## Magic Spells & Prayers

When an offensive magic spell is cast at another creature, that creature makes a saving throw (**1d20**). 
If they equal or beat their saving throw value, the spell misses. Some spells, such as Magic Missile, 
allow the caster to attack a creature's defence directly instead.

## Melee

When making a melee attack, roll a **1d20**. Apply any to-hit bonuses and compare it to the defence 
of the creature. If it equals or beats the score, your attack is successful. Roll damage and apply!
