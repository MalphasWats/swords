# Creating a Character

...intro...

## Attributes

The first step to creating your character is to roll **3d6** for each of the six attribute scores.

Keep in mind that your character will almost certainly have some scores that is lower than average. You do not begin as superior specimens of human perfection; You are flawed like anyone else.

What truly makes heroes of legend, in the end, is not what they were born with; it is what they achieve, in a risky life full of adventure, peril, and courage – and sometimes lots of trickery and guile, too.

### Strength

Your character's strength determines how easily they hit with a melee weapon, as well as giving a bonus to the damage they do.

| Attribute Score | To Hit Modifier | Damage Bonus |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|:------------:|
|       3-4       |       -2        |      -1      |
|       5-6       |       -1        |       0      |
|       7-12      |        0        |       0      |
|      13-15      |       +1        |      +1      |
|        16       |       +1        |      +2      |
|        17       |       +2        |      +3      |
|        18       |       +2        |      +4      |

### Dexterity

Dexterity determines your character's speed and nimbleness when performing delicate tasks.
A high dexterity will give a bonus to attack rolls when using ranged weapons, and make you lighter on your feet in combat.

| Attribute Score | To Hit Modifier | Defence Bonus |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|
|       3-6       |       -1        |       0       |
|       7-9       |        0        |       0       |
|      10-12      |        0        |      +1       |
|      13-16      |       +1        |      +2       |
|      17-18      |       +2        |      +3       |

### Constitution

Constitution is the measure of your ability to withstand and recover from the wounds inflicted in combat and other activities.

| Attribute Score | Hit Point Modifier | HP regained / day |
|:---------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
|       3-8       |         -1         |         0         |
|       9-12      |          0         |        +1         |
|      13-18      |         +1         |        +2         |

### Intelligence

Intelligence governs your ability to understand the world around you. Mages require a high intelligence in order to remember and understand their spells.

|      16-18      |         5        |        +2        |

### Wisdom

Wisdom is a measure of your knowledge of the history, science and politics of the world in which you live, along with your self-awareness. It determines how quickly you recover your powers.

### Hit Points

Your hit points are an abstraction of the wounds and injuries you have sustained.

You begin at level 1 with a single **Hit Die**, gaining one each level that you gain. For each hit die, roll **1d6** and add the result to determine your base hit points. Add any bonuses from your Constitution attribute score, Class and sometimes Race.

### Mana

Magic using characters require Mana to work their spells.

Each level, roll **1d4** and add any bonuses from your intelligence to determine your Mana Pool.
Roll **1d2** and add any bonus from Wisdom to determine your mana regeneration per hour.

### Focus

Martial characters need focus to pull off feats of strength and discipline.

Roll **1d6** to determine your maximum focus pool. You only gain focus points through action – vanquishing foes and achieving goals. Each time you strike a killing blow to an enemy, you gain 1 focus point, plus your Wisdom bonus. Your Game Master may also award you with focus points for completing  tasks and other feats.

### Defence

Your defence attribute determines how hard you are to hit. It is primarily determined by the armour you are wearing (see equipment table), along with bonuses from your Dexterity, Class and sometimes Race. 

A Naked character has a defence of 9.

### Gold

When you begin the game, roll **3d6** and multiply the total by 10. 

You have that many gold pieces and may buy equipment from the [equipment table](items.html).

Generally, a character with a strength of 10 can wear armour lighter than plate, carry a weapon and backpack. Carrying more than this takes effort and may affect your performance!


## Character Class

Once you have determined your statistics, you may [choose your character class](classes.html)


## Character Race

There are many races in the world. Some of them bring bonuses to their abilities. [Choose your character race](races.html)
