# Creating a Character

...intro...

## Attributes

The first step to creating your character is to roll 3d6 for each of the six attribute scores.

Keep in mind that your character will almost certainly have some scores that is lower than average. You do not begin as superior specimens of human perfection; You are flawed like anyone else.

What truly makes heroes of legend, in the end, is not what they were born with; it is what they achieve, in a risky life full of adventure, peril, and courage â€“ and sometimes lots of trickery and guile, too.
