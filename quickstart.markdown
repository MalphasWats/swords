Adventure

# Adventure

## Introduction

*Adventure* is heavily based on Swords and Wizardry with a few tweaks that I think make it more fun.


## Character Creation

### The Character Sheet

Your character sheet needs only be a simple piece of paper...

### Attributes

The basic attributes of a character are numbers representing

- Strength (muscle power), 
- Dexterity (quickness and coordination), 
- Constitution (general health and hardiness), 
- Intelligence (education and IQ), 
- Wisdom (common sense),
- Charisma (leadership). 

The first step to creating your character is to roll 3d6 for each of the six attribute scores. 

Keep in mind that your character will almost certainly have at least one score that is lower than average. This is not a game of armoured super-heroes! The great wizards and knights of the world do not begin as superior specimens of human perfection; they are flawed like anyone else. 

What truly makes heroes of legend, in the end, is not what they were born with; it is what they achieve, in a risky life full of adventure, peril, and courage â€“ and sometimes lots of trickery and guile, too.

#### Strength

Your character's strength is the measure of her physical prowess; how hard can she swing a sword? How fast can she run?

Having a high strength gives your character a bonus to both their attack rolls and damage when attacking with melee weapons, likewise, a low score could leave her too weak even to lift her sword!

| attribute score | to hit modifier | damage bonus |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
|       3-4       |       -2        |      -1      |
|       5-6       |       -1        |       0      |
|       7-8       |        0        |       0      |
|       9-12      |        0        |       0      |
|      13-15      |       +1        |       0      |
|       16        |       +1        |      +1      |
|       17        |       +2        |      +2      |
|       18        |       +2        |      +3      |


#### Dexterity

Dexterity determines your character's speed and nimbleness when performing delicate tasks.

Having a high dexterity will give your character a bonus to attack rolls and damage when using ranged weapons and make him lighter on his feet when defending against attackers.

| attribute score | to hit modifier | defence bonus |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
|       3-6       |       -1        |       0       |
|       7-12      |        0        |       0       |
|      13-15      |       +1        |      +1       |
|      16-18      |       +2        |      +2       |
